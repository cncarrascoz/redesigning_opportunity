# Opportunity Map - Icon-Based Filtering Prototype

## Project Information
- **GitHub Username**: MahiaRahman9971
- **Repository**: redesigning_opportunity
- **Linear Issue ID**: OPP-8
- **Branch**: MahiaRahman9971-hw6-2

## Project Description
This is the second rapid prototype for the Opportunity Map feature, focusing on **Filtering Logic Variation using an Icon-Based Selection System**. The prototype allows parents to filter neighborhoods based on school quality by selecting icons instead of entering a numerical value.

### Key Features
- Interactive choropleth map of neighborhoods, color-coded by Opportunity Score
- Icon-based filtering system (üè´) for school quality
- Neighborhoods with school quality below the selected level are grayed out
- Real-time map updates as filters are adjusted
- Hover functionality to display neighborhood details

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Material UI
- **Mapping**: Mapbox GL JS
- **Data**: Hardcoded neighborhood data (no backend or API calls)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
